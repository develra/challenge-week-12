## Challenge 2

This dataset is awesome! I use reddit (way too often), so there are some tropes and cliches
among the community I am curious about. I wonder how comment length has an impact on the score. 
I would assume longer answers are often better, but also take longer to evaluate, meaning many users
won't spend the time to actually stop and read the comment to see if it is worth rating. My guess would
be that the shorter comments tend to have a statistically lower up/down ratio, but many more votes.
This probably also varies depending on subreddit.

db.reddit.find({subreddit:"runescape"}).count("ups")
db.reddit.find({subreddit:"runescape"}).count("downs")

## Challenge 3

As previously stated. I think we could discover many things about the variation between subreddits, and using
the data such as up/down votes, as well as some basic information about comments, glean some insight into the way that various subreddits use, view, and interact with the comment system. 

## Challenge 4

I assume it would tell us many interesting things about the way various subreddits interact and how the community
segregates itself as a whole; it seems as if it would be difficult to draw interesting conclusions about outside
correlations without using some sort of NLP.

## Challenge 5

Which two of the top 50 subreddits share the most common commenters? (i.e., try to find the 2 subreddits that share the most number of users commenting in them)
